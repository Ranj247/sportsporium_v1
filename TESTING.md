### Validation
- Tested [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) No errors or warnings to show. This validator does not recognise Jinja templates & scripting, so returns errors for the lines of code where Jinja is used - this is to be expected. No errors are present in the HTML code otherwise.
- Tested [CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) No errors found.<br><br>
    

- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the JavaScript code in the script.js file. No errors are present.
- [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/) was used to validate that the Python code in app.py is PEP8 compliant. No errors are present.<br><br>
